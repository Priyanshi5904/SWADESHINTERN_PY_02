### Web Scraper Project

This Python project is a web scraper designed to extract data from the website "Books to Scrape." It fetches book titles, prices, and availability information from multiple pages and stores the data in a CSV file. 

#### Features:
- Scrapes multiple pages of book data from the given website.
- Extracts book title, price, and availability status.
- Saves the scraped data into a CSV file for further analysis or usage.
- Includes error handling for network issues or server errors.
- Simple and flexible design using Python, `requests`, and `BeautifulSoup`.

#### How to use:
1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```
3. The script will scrape the first three pages of the website and save the data in `books_scraped.csv`.

#### Libraries used:
- `requests`: To handle HTTP requests.
- `BeautifulSoup`: To parse the HTML and extract book details.
- `csv`: To write the scraped data into a CSV file.

#### Potential Improvements:
- Add functionality to scrape all pages.
- Implement dynamic user inputs for number of pages and URL targets.
- Extend scraping to include additional data like book ratings.
